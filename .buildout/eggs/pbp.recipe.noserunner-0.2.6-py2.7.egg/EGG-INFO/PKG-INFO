        QuickStart
        **********
        
        `pbp.recipe.noserunner` will let you create a `Nose` test runner script in 
        your buildout. Here's an example of the simplest configuration::
        
            [buildout]
            parts = test
        
            [test]
            recipe = pbp.recipe.noserunner
        
        If you run the builout, a `test` script will be created in the bin directory to
        run your tests using Nose.

        Supported options
        =================
        
        The recipe supports the following options:
        
        eggs
            The eggs option specified a list of eggs to test given as one ore
            more setuptools requirement strings.  Each string must be given on
            a separate line.
        
        script
            The script option gives the name of the script to generate, in the
            buildout bin directory.  Of the option isn't used, the part name
            will be used.
        
        extra-paths
            One or more extra paths to include in the generated test script.
        
        defaults
            The defaults option lets you specify testrunner default
            options. These are specified as Python source for an expression
            yielding a list, typically a list literal.
        
        working-directory
            The working-directory option lets to specify a directory where the
            tests will run. The testrunner will change to this directory when
            run. If the working directory is the empty string or not specified
            at all, the recipe will not change the current working directory.
        
        environment
            A set of environment variables that should be exported before
            starting the tests.
